## About

This repo is used to share some information about myself with the class and to share some tools that I find useful for web development.

## Recommended Tools

The only tools that you need to get started with web development is an internet connection and a web browser. Github pages is a good place to start and that uses the Markdown language which takes plain text and converts it to HTML.

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjwkqPrBRA3EiwAKdtwkz2xF5LUvOYhiah-lMifRULgPWuc0CFiOKccVcKN4ti7zPAsMKYn_BoCBXoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
