Ben - 02

I am a senior currently working on my Bachelors of Applied Computer Science and this is my last semester before I graduate.

I am from Kansas City, Kansas and before I decided to continue my education at NWMSU, I graduated from Johnson County Community College with an Associates Degree in Game Development. I enjoy making games but there aren't a lot of job opportunities in Kansas City for game development, so I decided to try and get my Bachelors degree in Computer Science in order to make it easier to get a job.

One day I hope to get a job writing code but I'm not very picky about what kind of field of work it would be.  I would also be wiling to work in IT, databasing,  or software development.
